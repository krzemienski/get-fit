## Project Requirements Document for GetFit Cards - Interactive Fitness Card Game

### 1. Project Overview

**GetFit Cards** is an innovative fitness application designed to transform workout routines into an engaging card game, accessible through both mobile and web platforms. This app caters to users across varying fitness levels, presenting a dynamic workout experience by shuffling a deck of exercise cards. Each card represents a specific exercise with motivational prompts, thereby guiding users through personalized workout sessions. The app not only introduces an element of play in fitness but also fosters self-motivation and discipline by tracking user progress and offering challenges.

The primary goals of building GetFit Cards include making workouts more enjoyable and interactive, catering to individual fitness levels, and using gamification to enhance user engagement. By integrating motivational elements and tracking features, the app aims to keep users invested in their fitness journey, encouraging them to achieve their health goals through consistent and adaptive workout routines. Success for this app will be measured by user activity, satisfaction, and the ability to maintain or increase their workout commitments over time.

### 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**

*   Mobile and Web Application development.
*   Shuffle-able deck of exercise cards with motivational phrases.
*   Workout session management including start, stop, and tracking.
*   User difficulty levels: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced.
*   Time-based workouts with performance tracking.
*   Data storage for workout history: exercises, times, and optional calorie estimation.
*   Gamification elements like streak rewards, badges, and daily challenges.
*   Basic and OAuth-based user authentication.
*   Initial UI/UX design and branding.

**Out-of-Scope:**

*   AI-powered workout suggestions (planned for later release).
*   Multiplayer and Social interaction features.
*   Wearable device integrations.
*   Advanced analytics beyond basic performance insights.
*   Premium or subscription-based content.

### 3. User Flow

A typical journey for a new user of GetFit Cards begins with launching the app and signing up via email or through OAuth platforms like Google or Facebook for convenience. After setting up an account, the user lands on a vibrant and intuitive dashboard where they can choose between different workout modes such as Standard, Timed, or Challenge, and set their preferred difficulty level. This customization allows a tailored workout experience right from the start.

After selecting the workout parameters, the user shuffles through a digital deck of exercise cards that present one exercise at a time. Post completion of each exercise, the user taps the “Next” button to seamlessly transition to the subsequent card. The sessions conclude with a summary of their workout milestones, time logged, and any rewards or badges earned, which motivate the user to return and engage with the app consistently.
